The main application consists of these three files:
* index.html
* main-compiled.js
* main.css

To test the uncompiled version of the site, you can use these:
* index_test.html
* main.js

These depend on you having the Google Closure Library in this
directory, under 'closure-library'. You can use 'getclosure.sh' to
download that (and the Google Closure Compiler) for you. For a more
elaborate introduction and tutorial, check out:
http://code.google.com/closure/library/docs/gettingstarted.html

To compile the code yourself, use 'compile.sh'. This will compile
'main.js' into 'main-compiled.js'.
